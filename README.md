OpenGL Projects Showcase
This repository highlights my skills in OpenGL through three interactive projects:

Raindrop Simulation: A realistic animation of falling raindrops, demonstrating basic graphics rendering and animation.
Space Shooter Game: A 2D game where a spaceship shoots falling balls, showcasing game mechanics and collision detection.
Flappy Bird Upgrade: An enhanced version of the classic Flappy Bird game, focusing on physics-based movement and dynamic obstacles.
Each project is built using Python and OpenGL, emphasizing creative graphics, interactivity, and algorithmic implementation.
